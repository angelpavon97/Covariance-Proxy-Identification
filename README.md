# Covariance Proxy Identification

Covariance Proxy Identification is an approach to identify and mitigate bias in machine learning (ML) models by uncovering attributes in datasets that act as proxies for sensitive information (e.g., maternity leave as a proxy for gender). By identifying and removing these proxies, the approach reduces ML bias.  

This repository contains the implementation of the Covariance Proxy Identification approach and notebooks for reproducing the experiments outlined in the paper: https://oro.open.ac.uk/88769/
